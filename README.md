# Star Rating Prediction on Amazon Customer Reviews Dataset using NLP and ML

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to use Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning algorithms to predict Amazonâ€™s product ratings from the customers' review comments and other related variables. Exploratory Data Analysis will also perform before applying any models to understand the dataset better. 

## Data Source

Amazon Customer Reviews Dataset is one of the public datasets available on AWS. It provided over 130+ million customer reviews for products sold on Amazon from 1995 until 2015. The reviews generated by Amazon customers describe their experience with the products offered. This dataset is in the amazon-reviews-pds S3 bucket in AWS US East Region. The Amazon Customer Review Dataset is available in tsv and parquet files. We can access the dataset using the AWS Command Line Interface. The location of the tsv files is s3://amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/ and the location of the parquet files is s3://amazon-reviews-pds/parquet/. Each line in the data files corresponds to an individual product review.

* marketplace (string): 2-letter country code of the marketplace where the review was written
* customer_id (integer): the random identifier that can be used to aggregate reviews written by a single author
* review_id (string): the unique id of the review
* product_id (string): the unique product id the review pertains to
* product_parent (integer): the random identifier that can be used to aggregate reviews for the same product
* product_title (string): title of the product
* product_category (string): broad product category that can be used to group reviews
* star_rating (string): the 1-5 star rating of the review
* helpful_votes (integer): number of helpful votes
